# Thread Hello Count

This program is for print out the thread that is being excuted now. Why it's not (Hello,0,Hello,1,Hello,2,...)? because of two reasons, the first one is that the sleep time is random(Math.random()) and the second reason is that there is much more services in the OS not only that two.
